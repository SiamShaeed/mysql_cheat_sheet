The WHERE clause allows you to specify a search condition for the rows returned by a query. The following shows the syntax of the WHERE clause :

SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    search_condition;


The following query uses the WHERE clause to find all employees whose job titles are Sales Rep:
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep';


The following example uses the WHERE clause to find employees whose job titles are Sales Rep and office codes are 1:
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle,
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    jobtitle = 'Sales Rep' AND 
    officeCode = 1;

The following query returns employees with office code less than or equal 4 (<=4):
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    officeCode
FROM
    employees
WHERE 
    officecode <= 4;
